	<long_description>With KoreanKii, you can add or remove the Korean key from your SEEPROM.  This eliminates the need for patching IOS60 into slots if you have a region changed Korean Wii.  See http:\\tinyurl.com\KoreanKii for more info.

This program comes with no warranty.  You, and you alone are responsible if this damages your Wii in any way.
All code in seeprom.c is by tueidj and Team Twiizers, I claim no rights to it.  This is simply a UI for the code.</long_description>
